a simple program that stores all notes encrypted using an encryption program 

this program allows user to add notes, view notes, delete notes

# aim of the project
i mainly made this to learn about file handling and also to gain knowledge on making projects 
i also wanted to learn how to have a program to store all my notes without anyone seeing what i have written and this fits it perfectly
